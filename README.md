## QuillConnect Documentation
# 1. Introduction
QuillConnect is a social media platform where users can:
Create accounts.
Post images, text, or both.
Follow and interact with other users by liking and commenting on posts.
Chat with users in real-time through a WebSocket-powered chat system.
Manage a profile page displaying personal details, posts, and followers/following.
# 2. Technology Stack
Front-end: React with Chakra UI for responsive and reusable components.
Back-end: Node.js with Express for API management.
Database: MongoDB for storing users, posts, comments, and follower/following relationships.
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO for live chat and displaying online friends.
Hosting: Vercel for front-end hosting.
# 3. Features and Implementation
3.1 User Authentication
Current Setup: Basic login and registration forms. No added security mechanisms such as JWT or OAuth are implemented yet.
Future Improvement: For enhanced security, consider implementing token-based authentication using JWT or OAuth for session management.
3.2 Profile Management
Users can view their profile, which includes:
Profile picture.
Cover picture.
Personal information (editable via a form).
List of their posts.
Display of followers and followings.
Implementation:
Profile editing is handled through a simple form, allowing users to update their details.
Changes are submitted via API calls to the backend, where they are updated in MongoDB.
3.3 Posts
Users can post content in the form of text, images, or a combination of both.
Image Upload:
Images are uploaded without any size or format restrictions.
No additional optimizations for file storage or compression are implemented yet.
Future Improvement: Consider adding file size limits or optimizations to ensure performance on larger uploads.
3.4 Followers and Following
Each user has two arrays in their database schema:
Followers: Stores the user IDs of those following the user.
Following: Stores the user IDs of users that the current user is following.
Implementation: Following/unfollowing is implemented through API calls that update these arrays in MongoDB.
3.5 Real-time Chat
Implementation: Real-time chat is powered by Socket.IO, which allows users to exchange messages instantly.
Online Friends: Users who are online are displayed on the homepage through a WebSocket connection.
3.6 UI Design
The interface is designed using Chakra UI, which provides reusable, responsive components that simplify front-end development.
User Experience: The UI provides a clean and minimal design, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
3.7 Hosting
The front-end of QuillConnect is hosted on Vercel, providing fast and reliable deployment.
No CI/CD pipelines have been set up, but this could be a future enhancement to streamline deployment processes.
# 4. Areas for Improvement
Security: Implement token-based authentication like JWT and OAuth.
Image Handling: Add file size and format restrictions to improve performance.
Notifications: Implement real-time notifications for likes, comments, and new messages.
Scalability: Introduce caching mechanisms and consider load balancing strategies as the platform grows.
